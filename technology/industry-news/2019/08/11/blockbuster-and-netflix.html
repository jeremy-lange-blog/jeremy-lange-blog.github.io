                    <h1>History Is Written By the Victors</h1>

<p>If you’ll indulge me, try to remember back to the year 2000. Y2K mania was rampant, Bush and Gore were on the last legs of their respective campaigns, 
<em>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</em> had just been published. <em>Blockbuster Video</em> stores could be seen on practically every block. You remember Blockbuster Video, right? 
The conglomorate that people nowadays say never saw the writing on the wall and refused to adapt to modern times. The ones that had the chance to buy Netflix around this 
very year for $50 million dollars and refused to do so because they lacked vision. Yes, around this time that very Blockbuster was hard at work attempting 
to build an online streaming platform. You heard that right. <strong>Blockbuster Video</strong>, not Netflix, was developing a <strong>streaming platform</strong> back in the year 2000.</p>

<p>Nuts right? The first time I heard that 
I didn’t believe it. For context, Netflix would first debut their streaming service in <strong>2007</strong> (with only around 1000 titles available<sup id="fnref:ars-netflix-stream"><a href="#fn:ars-netflix-stream" class="footnote">1</a></sup>). 
For a good portion of Netflix’s history they didn’t compete against Blockbuster as a streaming service. They competed as an online DVD rental service!</p>

<p>For a company accused of being relic of the 80’s-90’s that had no place in the turn of the century, that’s a pretty bold and revolutionary 
product to be working on in the year 2000. There’s some truth to the narrative people push, but I’d argue it’s not quite as cut and dry as the narrative 
would have you believe.</p>

<h2 id="streaming-and-the-war-on-rentals">Streaming and the War on Rentals</h2>

<p>If you’ll continue our 20-odd year trip back in time, you may remember there was another famous company around then by the name of <strong>Enron</strong> <sup id="fnref:enron"><a href="#fn:enron" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. 
On July 19<sup>th</sup> 2000, Blockbuster and Enron inked a 20-year deal to produce an streaming movies on demand service. Enron would handle the technical 
aspects of this solution and Blockbuster would take care of licensing side of things, attempting to get the rights to stream as much content as 
possible from providers. The end product would be a home device that connected to your TV and would allow you choose various movies and media and rent them for around the same price
as a normal Blockbuster rental. It would allow consumers to “choose movies through an on-screen display” and give them “VCR-like control (pause, rewind, stop) of those selections”. <sup id="fnref:market-watch"><a href="#fn:market-watch" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>So why has no one heard of this? Well, what was supposed to be the “killer app for the entertainment industry”<sup id="fnref:wsj-no-substance"><a href="#fn:wsj-no-substance" class="footnote">4</a></sup> never really saw much use.
Enron released this service to about 3 cities and about 1,000 customers total, many of which weren’t paying anything. The profits were laughable.
The rentals for <em>The Carebears Movie</em> raked in whopping $8.40.<sup id="fnref:smartest-room"><a href="#fn:smartest-room" class="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, this 20-year deal only lasted 8 months, with both parties mutually agreeing to terminate the agreement in March of 2001. Enron would go on to blame Blockbuster, 
claiming they were not generating deals fast enough (at the time Blockbuster only had 2 major studio deals). Blockbuster would go on to say Enron’s solution had 
“technical and security issues” and “lost confidence in Enron as a partner”<sup id="fnref:wsj"><a href="#fn:wsj" class="footnote">6</a></sup>. Beth McLean and Peter Elkind attribute the failure of this project to another 
one of Enron’s accounting schemes.</p>

<p>According to the duo, this venture was doomed to fail. Enron cared more about inking the deal than actually following through. If Enron had the deal in the books, they could
work some account voodoo to make the deal look like a huge success. 
Even when they tried to follow through, it was not technically feasible at the time. Enron had issues overcoming the last mile problem. They could get as far as storing and archiving the
movies digitally, but delivering those movies to people via DSL and dial-up was just not physically possible<sup id="fnref:internet-numbers"><a href="#fn:internet-numbers" class="footnote">7</a></sup>.
Despite the fact that there weren’t many paying customers, Enron managed to flex their accounting prowess and book this failed venture 
as a profit of $53 million dollars.<sup id="fnref:smartest-room:1"><a href="#fn:smartest-room" class="footnote">5</a></sup>.’</p>

<p>Still, I would argue the fact that Blockbuster even entertained the idea of streaming media flys in the face of the narrative around them. 
Even if they got swindled, they were trying to innovate.</p>

<h2 id="and-heres-where-the-narrative-kicks-in">And here’s where the narrative kicks in.</h2>

<p>After that Blockbuster spent most of their time catching up to Netflix. What was a gimmicky website that was bleeding money in 2000 became a major player in the rental
industry in 2002, when more homes now had DVD players. Blockbuster, who made a lot of their profits on gouging their customers with late fees, found themselves in a dog fight
with Netflix. For most of the time Blockbuster would be playing catch-up to Netflix, launching Blockbuster Online, their own online DVD rental service.</p>

<p>The one other noteworthy thing Blockbuster delivered came in 2007, Total Access. With total access a Blockbuster Online customer 
could take movies rented online and exchange them in any Blockbuster store for a free rental. This campaign was so successful that “[m]embership in Blockbuster 
Online just about doubled in only six weeks.”<sup id="fnref:motley-fool"><a href="#fn:motley-fool" class="footnote">8</a></sup> It finally felt like Blockbuster Video found a way to leverage their store presence as a competitive adavantage
over Netflix. The numbers were still less than Netflix’s subscriber count, but this program was gaining traction. Some more time and Blockbuster may have still been in the conversation. 
Alas things were not meant to be.</p>

<p>An activist investor by the name of Carl Ihcan was furious with the amount of money Blockbuster was losing through Total Access (they lost $2 per DVD exchanged, 
but the hope was to lure customers away from Netflix back to Blockbuster to make up for the cost) and conspired to have the current CEO, John Antioco, removed. 
Jim Keyes took over as the CEO of Blockbuster.</p>

<p>Keyes cut funding to Total Access, causing Blockbuster Online subscriptions to plummet. His mentality going in was that “Neither RedBox nor Netflix are even 
on the radar screen in terms of competition, it’s more Wal-Mart and Apple”. He vowed to get into streaming media with the MediaPoint, a device that lets you 
digitally rent movies. At this point Netflix launched their online subscription and Cable boxes 
had already debuted Video on Demand. What would have been revolutionary in 2000 is just late to the game in 2008. 
And Keyes wasn’t about to go all in on digital streaming until 2012, when he felt streaming services would be viable. 
“Should we put shareholder money at risk in a market that’s at best five years away from being commercial? I don’t think so.” <sup id="fnref:fool-keyes"><a href="#fn:fool-keyes" class="footnote">9</a></sup></p>

<p>In 2010 Blockbuster would go on to close over half of their stores and file for bankruptcy. From there it would be a slow and painful death for the former
rental giant.<sup id="fnref:dish"><a href="#fn:dish" class="footnote">10</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="writing-history">Writing history</h2>

<p>Don’t get me wrong. My intention here isn’t to paint Blockbuster as an unfortunate soul ravaged by rotten luck. There’s a fair bit the leadership did to steer this Hindenberg towards disaster.
I just find it fascinating that such projects came out of a company that will forever be remembered as an ancient relic. It’s crazy what can be forgotten or glossed over after a few years.</p>

      <p>For those that don’t remember, Enron was an energy company famous for lighting up the stock market. Their method of commodotizing gas and electricity changed how energy contracts were done. However in 2001 all of this came screeching to a halt when their fradulent accounting caught up to them, forcing them to file for bankruptcy. The COO (and at one point CEO) Jeff Skilling would serve over 10 years in prison, while the CEO for a majority of Enron’s life, Ken Lay, would die of a heart attack before being tried. <a href="#fnref:enron" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
