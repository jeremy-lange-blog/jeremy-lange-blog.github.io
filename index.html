            <p>If youâ€™ll indulge me, try to remember back to the year 2000. Y2K mania was rampant, Bush and Gore were on the last legs of their respective campaigns, 
<em>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</em> had just been published. <em>Blockbuster Video</em> stores could be seen on practically every block. You remember Blockbuster Video, right? 
The conglomorate that people nowadays say never saw the writing on the wall and refused to adapt to modern times. The ones that had the chance to buy Netflix around this 
very year for $50 million dollars and refused to do so because they lacked vision. Yes, around this time that very Blockbuster was hard at work attempting 
to build an online streaming platform. You heard that right. <strong>Blockbuster Video</strong>, not Netflix, was developing a <strong>streaming platform</strong> back in the year 2000.</p>
